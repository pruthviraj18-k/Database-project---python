# Database-project---python - Vaccine Dosage Update 

SQLite3: The SQLite3 database is used for storing and managing the vaccination details.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): The project utilizes the command-line interface to interact with users and display the vaccination records.

Implementation Steps:
1. Data file -1 : Set up the SQLite3 database with the necessary tables to store user details.
2. Add the personal information and store it.
3. Implement the data retrieval functionality, which prompts users to enter their name and Aadhar number and other details that are asked, 
searches the database for the corresponding vaccination details from data file -1.
4. Handle errors and provide appropriate messages for scenarios such as invalid inputs or when user details are not found.
5. Test the code, ensuring that all functionalities are working as expected.
6. If the entered credentials are all valid user is allowed to enter the No of Vaccines doses taken. The Dosage details along with Aadhar number and mobiles details are stored in separate Data file i.e - Data file -2 and prints in the details in tuple format.
